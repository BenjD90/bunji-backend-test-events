synchronize events between Bunji app and their Google calendar (two way sync).

## Goal

The goal is to be able to create a two way sync calendar sync between :

- our dummy Bunji event app
- a dummy simplfied Google Calendar API

The idea is to be ale to test your :

- technical skills
- code quality

## Guidelines

- You should use the Bunji dummy Node.js app as a starting Point
- you are free to add any library you deem neceessary
- here is the documentation for the dummy google calendar dummy api (it is protected by api token) : https://github.com/chrisbag/google-events-dummy
- bear in mind that the bunji and google events models are slightly different
- to simplify approach, ignore timzeones
- feel free to add any required fields to the Bunji event or user models

## Functionnalit√© minimale attendues
